ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jackson, and I'm a student software developer from New Zealand.  

#### What I'm doing now
I'm studying at Victoria University of Wellington, where I am also a tutor in the Faculty of Engineering.

I am the developer of [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz), a grade tracking site used by 250+ university students all across Aotearoa. I also work on a Discord bot called [Jacksonbot](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/jacksonbot) that has a bunch of fun features and games.

I'm currently trying to create a functional and highly-available [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to host my projects, namely [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz) and [Jacksonbot](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/jacksonbot).

My favourite tools are C#, React/JavaScript, and Rust. In my spare time I've also been learning Vue 3, and I intend to learn about Svelte in the future.
