ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jackson, and I'm a student software developer from New Zealand.  I'm studying at Victoria University of Wellington.

My favourite tools are C#, React, Rust, and Zig. 

I'm particularly proud of [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz), my all-in-one grade tracking site, and [abyss](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/abyss), a Discord bot with fun commands and games.
