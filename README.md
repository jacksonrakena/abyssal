ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jackson, and I'm a student software developer from New Zealand.  

#### What I'm doing now
I'm in the last year of my computer science degree at Victoria University of Wellington, where I am also a tutor in the Faculty of Engineering.   

I have two years of commercial software engineering experience, including at [SeeEverything](https://github.com/seeeverything) and [GoCloud](https://www.gocloud.systems/).

I am the creator of [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz), a grade tracking site used by 370+ university students at 15+ universities and colleges around the world. I also work on a multiplayer, friendly casino game called [Ace In The Hole](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/ace-in-the-hole) that's a ton of fun, and a home-grown low-level C# networking library called [Promul](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/promul) to support it.

I'm also interested in DevOps and infrastructure management, with one of my latest projects being a functional [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to host my projects, namely [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz) and [Jacksonbot](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/jacksonbot). You can follow my progress and view my manifests in the [infrastructure](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/infrastructure) repo.

My favourite tools are C#, React/JavaScript, and Rust. In my spare time I've also been learning Unreal Engine and C++, and I intend to learn about Svelte in the future.
