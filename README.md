ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jackson, and I'm a student software developer from New Zealand.  

#### What I'm doing now
I'm studying at Victoria University of Wellington, where I am also a tutor in the Faculty of Engineering.

I am the developer of [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz), a grade tracking site used by 350+ university students all across Aotearoa. I also work on a casino game called [Ace In The Hole](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/ace-in-the-hole) that's a ton of fun, and a home-grown low-level C# networking library called [Promul](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/promul) to support it.

I'm currently trying to create a functional and highly-available [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to host my projects, namely [Gradekeeper](https://gradekeeper.xyz) and [Jacksonbot](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/jacksonbot). You can follow my progress and view my manifests in the [arthur-cluster-manifest](https://github.com/jacksonrakena/arthur-cluster-manifest) repo.

My favourite tools are C#, React/JavaScript, and Rust. In my spare time I've also been learning Vue 3, and I intend to learn about Svelte in the future.
