        In 2022, I led the development of a React-based call center solution
        using Amazon Connect that was deployed nationally to Plunketâ€™s at-home
        care service. This solution involved 4 repositories, 30,000 lines of
        code, and over 100 total AWS resources organized with CloudFormation and
        remains the proudest piece of work in my career.
        <br />
        <br />
        PlunketLine is a free, 24/7/365 helpline for new parents, providing
        medical information and assistance to those who need it most. 24 hours a
        day, 365 days a year, thousands of nurses from across the Plunket
        organisation log on to their computers and answer calls from concerned
        parents and caregivers across New Zealand. <br />
        <br />
        Our system needed to never miss a beat and be super simple to use for
        customers, and our engineering work and design delivered a product that
        meets every need for Plunket.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also handled the transition from a legacy on-premise call center
        solution to our cloud-based solution built on top of Amazon Connect,
        including porting numbers, creating documentation training staff, and
        ensuring that the transition was as smooth as possible.

        The Visitor App was a React-based app connected to a DynamoDB database
        using AWS Lambda, that handled visitor induction and safety paperwork
        for hundreds of visitors entering Garage Project sites every day across
        Wellington.
        <br />
        <br />I engineered the application{"'"}s structure to support both
        Google and Microsoft (MSAL) systems, so that a staff member was alerted
        and sent the filled-in paperwork when a visitor completed the form.
        <br />
        <br /> I also pushed for the system design to be fully generic and
        turn-key, so that our company could, within a day, deploy this system to
        a new client with minimal configuration and zero code changes.

            OpenModServer is a web application for managing and hosting
            modifications for popular video games. It provides an easy-to-use
            interface for game players to download new mods for their favourite
            games, a simple way for mod developers to upload their mods, and a
            way for site administrators to moderate and verify submissions. It
            is built using ASP.NET Core, with a PostgreSQL database for storing
            user data.

            <Heading size="sm">Moderation</Heading>
            Accepting arbitrary user uploads has always been a challenge for
            websites, and OpenModServer is no exception. To combat this,
            OpenModServer uses a moderation system, where users can submit mods
            for approval, and site administrators can review and approve or
            reject them.
            <br />
            <br />
            This system is built using a PostgreSQL database, with a table for
            mods, releases, verifications, and users. In addition, OpenModServer
            automatically submits uploads to virus-checking site VirusTotal, and
            periodically pings VirusTotal to check if it has finished processing
            the file. Once it has been processed, OpenModServer will show the
            result to the site administrators in the review process.
